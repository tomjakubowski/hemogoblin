/// We use SysV semaphores to implement per-pool locks.  Each pool has
/// its own semaphore set, created either at pool creation time or
/// first access after the system has booted.  The semaphore id (used
/// to retrieve the semaphores) is stored in the pool configuration
/// file, and each pool participate must get a reference to the
/// semaphores.  Semaphores are for local pools only; remote pools
/// handle all locking on the host machine.
///
/// Semaphore descriptions:
///
/// Deposit lock: While this lock is held, no one else can deposit in
/// the pool.  This is useful for (a) making a deposit, (b) eliminating
/// race windows while checking for deposits.
///
/// Notification lock: This lock is held while pools are being notified
/// via the socket-based await mechanism, and while we are adding
/// ourselves to the notification list for this mechanism.  It could be
/// combined with the deposit lock, but we want to decouple deposits
/// from reads as much as possible.
///
/// Locks are implemented by setting the initial value to 1 (only one
/// "resource" available).  The lock operation subtracts 1 from the
/// value (taking the resource) and the unlock operation adds 1
/// (releasing the resource).  Both operations need the SEM_UNDO flag
/// so that the lock operation is reversed if the program dies before
/// releasing the lock itself.  The unlock operation needs the
/// SEM_UNDO flag because this feature is implemented by incrementing
/// the undo value when you lock the semaphore and decrementing the
/// undo value when you unlock the semaphore, and then adding the undo
/// value to the value of the semaphore when the program exits.  Note
/// that the OS has limits on how many simultaneous SEM_UNDO
/// operations can be in progress in the same process (that is, how
/// many threads in a process can be simultaneously calling semop()
/// with SEM_UNDO).  See the OS interface and limits documents for
/// more details.
///
/// All semaphore ops could be replaced with their pthread equivalents
/// if (1) cross-process pthread synchronization is supported, which
/// it is if the POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED sysconf() variable is
/// defined (it is on both Linux and Mac OS X) and (2) you use the
/// incredibly irritating pthread_cleanup_push() and
/// pthread_cleanup_pop() routines to execute an unlock function if
/// the function dies while holding the lock.  You would have to keep
/// the locks in a SysV shared memory segment.

/// SysV semaphores come in sets (arrays).  Allocate one array and
/// index into it to get each of the different semaphore types we
/// need.

// This is a little hint from the testing environment that
// ob_sleep() isn't being used.  (And obviously a reboot doesn't
// occur in the middle of the test suite.)  We want to make sure

/* Traditionally, sem_key is generated using ftok(), which typically
 * fills the 32 bits (from most to least significant) as follows:
 * ppppppppddddddddiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
 * where "p" is the "proj_id" supplied to ftok(), "d" is the device
 * number for the disk containing the file passed to ftok(), and "i"
 * is the inode for the file passed to ftok().
 * However, using ftok() requires that we write the config file twice
 * (first to create it so that ftok can use its inode, and then again
 * to write the resulting sem_key into the config file).  Also, 16 bits
 * of inode are not enough to be unique, so in practice we get conflicts,
 * especially on systems that haven't been rebooted in a while.
 *
 * For these reasons, we're not going to use ftok().  Instead, we'll
 * just generate sem_key randomly (and try again if we get a conflict).
 * However, to avoid conflicting with other programs on the system that
 * are using ftok(), we don't want to generate all 32 bits randomly.
 * We'll still use the upper 8 bits for "p", since this is the primary
 * means for programs to avoid stepping on each other.  Furthermore,
 * we'll set the most-significant "d" bit to 1, since device numbers
 * tend to be small integers; this will further reduce conflicts with
 * ftok users.  Thus, we have a fixed bit pattern for the upper 9 bits,
 * and we generate the lower 23 bits randomly.
 *
 * As for the choice of "p", we chose 0x0b, not only because it can
 * be pronounced "ob", but also because it seems to be a value for "p"
 * which is not commonly used.  Using Google Code Search to find uses
 * of ftok() across existing software, it appears that ASCII characters
 * are common, 1 is common, and 0 is sometimes used (even though 0 is
 * supposed to be illegal).  So a value between 2 and 31, such as 0x0b
 * (11) seems like a good choice.
